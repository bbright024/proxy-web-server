Brian's Proxy Web Server

Everything passes the autograder 100%, so I started adding other features.

The server uses IO multiplexing to respond to keyboard input with info on
the cache.

The cache uses the LinkedList API I coded for UW's CSE 333, with some
additional code I put in to implement a least-recently-used (LRU) 
algorithm in the linked list - LLIteratorMoveToHead moves the current
node pointed to by the iterator to the head of the list.

This directory contains the files you will need for the CS:APP Proxy
Lab.

proxy.c
csapp.h
csapp.c
    These are starter files.  csapp.c and csapp.h are described in
    your textbook. 

    You may make any changes you like to these files.  And you may
    create and handin any additional files you like.

    Please use `port-for-user.pl' or 'free-port.sh' to generate
    unique ports for your proxy or tiny server. 

Makefile
    This is the makefile that builds the proxy program.  Type "make"
    to build your solution, or "make clean" followed by "make" for a
    fresh build. 

    Type "make handin" to create the tarfile that you will be handing
    in. You can modify it any way you like. Your instructor will use your
    Makefile to build your proxy from source.

port-for-user.pl
    Generates a random port for a particular user
    usage: ./port-for-user.pl <userID>

free-port.sh
    Handy script that identifies an unused TCP port that you can use
    for your proxy or tiny. 
    usage: ./free-port.sh

driver.sh
    The autograder for Basic, Concurrency, and Cache.        
    usage: ./driver.sh

nop-server.py
     helper for the autograder.         

tiny
    Tiny Web server from the CS:APP text
